# LabGraph Interactive

## What is LabGraph?

**LabGraph** is a a Python-first framework used to build real-time research systems with *real-time streaming*, *graph API*, and *parallelism*. Facebook Researchers use it prototype wearable hardware systems and process digital signals under their [**VR/AR efforts**](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/) into the Metaverse. To put it simply, LabGraph sets the relationship between the inputs and outputs of computations and provides the needed tooling to run them in parallel and help developers focus on algorithms instead of the environment.
